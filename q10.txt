Reverse Split
Write a program to read a string and a character, and reverse the string and convert it in a format such that each character is separated by the given character. Print the final string.
Include a class UserMainCode with a static method reshape which accepts a string and a character. The return type (String) should return the final string.
Create a Class Main which would be used to accept a string and a character, and call the static method present in UserMainCode.
 
Input and Output Format:
Input consists of a string and a character.
Output consists of a string (the final string).
Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
Sample Input:
Rabbit
-
Sample Output:
t-i-b-b-a-R

package collection;
import java.util.*;
public class rabbit {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the string");
		String s=sc.next();
		System.out.println("Enter the character");
		char c=sc.next().charAt(0);
		StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer(s);
		
		sb.reverse();
		for(int i=1;i<sb.length();i=i+2){
		sb.insert(i,c);
		}
		System.out.println(sb);
		
	}
